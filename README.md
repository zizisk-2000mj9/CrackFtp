## Usage

To use CrackFtp, run the script from the command line. The basic syntax is:

```bash
python crackftp.py --target <ftp_server> --user <username_file> --pass <password_file>
```

### Example

```bash
python crackftp.py --target ftp.example.com --user users.txt --pass passwords.txt
```

This command will attempt to log in to `ftp.example.com` using usernames from `users.txt` and passwords from `passwords.txt`.

## How It Works

CrackFtp uses a straightforward approach to check FTP credentials. It connects to the specified FTP server and attempts to log in using combinations of usernames and passwords. If a successful login occurs, it logs the credentials and sends a notification via Telegram.

### Workflow

1. **Input Files**: Users provide a list of usernames and passwords in text files.
2. **Connection**: The script establishes a connection to the FTP server.
3. **Login Attempts**: It iterates through the provided credentials, attempting to log in.
4. **Notifications**: On success, it sends a notification to the specified Telegram bot.

## Telegram Notifications

To receive notifications, you need to set up a Telegram bot. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**:
   - Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
   - Use the command `/newbot` to create a new bot and follow the prompts.
   - Save the token provided by BotFather.

2. **Get Your Chat ID**:
   - Start a chat with your bot.
   - Use the following URL to get your chat ID:
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates
     ```
   - Look for your chat ID in the JSON response.

3. **Configure the Script**:
   - Edit the configuration file or pass the token and chat ID as command-line arguments when running the script.
